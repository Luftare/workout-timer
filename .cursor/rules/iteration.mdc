Implement the next unimplemented iteration. The user will test the product after you have implemented the listed features.

Treat the iterations as best guess. The spec will likely change as new things are discovered during the process. The iterations may be rewritten during the process.

Always mark the completed items in the TODO.md to keep it up to date.
